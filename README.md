# Learning Mono Repo

This mono repo is intended for all experiments that I do in my free time.
All code is not production ready, nor should I be judged on it. Use it at
own will do play around.

## Organization of the repo

* `doc`: Documentation and also misc notes.

## Commit messages

All commit messages should be structured like this:
(copied from https://git.tazj.in/tree/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

```
type(scope): Subject line with at most a 68 character length

Body of the commit message with an empty line between subject and
body. This text should explain what the change does and why it has
been made, *especially* if it introduces a new feature.

Relevant issues should be mentioned if they exist.
```

Where `type` can be one of:

* `feat`: A new feature has been introduced
* `fix`: An issue of some kind has been fixed
* `docs`: Documentation or comments have been updated
* `style`: Formatting changes only
* `refactor`: Hopefully self-explanatory!
* `test`: Added missing tests / fixed tests
* `chore`: Maintenance work

And `scope` should refer to some kind of logical grouping inside of the project.

Please take a look at the existing commit log for examples.
